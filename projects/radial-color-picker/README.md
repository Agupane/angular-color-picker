## Introduction

Great UX starts with two basic principles - ease of use and simplicity. Selecting a color should be as easy as moving a slider, clicking a checkbox or pressing a key just like other basic form elements behave.

This is a flexible and elegant material-ish design color picker. Developed with mobile devices in mind. Key features:
* Supports touch devices
* Angular animations

This component doesn't have feature parity with
it's [predecessor](https://github.com/talamaska/angular-radial-color-picker) for Angular 1.x

The component is developed so it can be used with template-driven or reactive form, or as a simple component.

## <a name="questions">First Asked Questions</a>

<details>
    <summary>Color picker uses <code>hex</code>. How can I use other formats like <code>rgb()</code> or hsl?</summary>
    <p>The color picker will recognize the format of the input, but will still work internally with hex value of the provided color. You can change the output format by setting the colorType property to <code>hex</code>, <code>rgb</code> or <code>hsl</code></p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>How to select other shades of the solid colors?</summary>
    <p>We suggest to add a custom slider for saturation and luminosity or use <code>&lt;input type="range"&gt;</code>.</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>How can I change the active color of the picker after initialization?</summary>
    <p><code>rcp-radial-color-picker</code> component uses <code>OnChanges lifecycle hook</code> to detect changes of the color binding. When using
    <code>&lt;rcp-radial-color-picker [color]="color"&gt;&lt;/rcp-radial-color-picker&gt;</code>
</details>
